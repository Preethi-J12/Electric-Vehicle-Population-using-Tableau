PROBLEM STATEMENT : Tableau Project/PROBLEM STATEMENT.pdf

The project focuses on creating visualizations to address the following requirements:
	1.	Total Vehicles by Model Year (From 2010 Onwards):
	•	Visualization: Line/Area Chart
	•	Description: Illustrates the distribution of EVs over the years, highlighting growth patterns and adoption trends.
	2.	Total Vehicles by State:
	•	Visualization: Map Chart
	•	Description: Displays the geographical distribution of EVs across states, identifying regions with higher adoption rates.
	3.	Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make:
	•	Visualization: Bar Chart
	•	Description: Highlights the top 10 EV manufacturers by total vehicles, providing insights into brand dominance.
	4.	Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility:
	•	Visualization: Pie/Donut Chart
	•	Description: Shows the proportion of EVs eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives, explaining the impact of incentives on adoption.
	5.	Total Vehicles by Model:
	•	Visualization: Grid View
	•	Description: Highlights the top 10 EV models by total vehicles, showcasing consumer preferences and popular models.

Tools Used
	•	Tableau: For creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.

Key Features
	•	Interactive dashboards to explore EV adoption trends.
	•	Detailed visualizations for regional and manufacturer-specific insights.
	•	Data-driven analysis to understand the impact of policies and consumer preferences.

This project demonstrates how data visualization tools like Tableau can provide actionable insights into electric vehicle adoption trends.

Here’s the README for the dataset:

Electric Vehicle Population Dataset

This dataset contains detailed information about electric vehicles (EVs) registered in various regions. It is used to analyze trends, adoption rates, and distribution patterns of EVs.

Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following attributes:
	1.	VIN (1-10): Partial Vehicle Identification Number.
	2.	County and City: Geographical location details of registered EVs.
	3.	State and Postal Code: State and ZIP code of the vehicle registration.
	4.	Model Year: Year of manufacture of the EV.
	5.	Make and Model: Manufacturer and specific model of the EV.
	6.	Electric Vehicle Type: EV category, such as Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV).
	7.	CAFV Eligibility: Eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle incentives.
	8.	Electric Range: Maximum range (in miles) of the EV on a full charge.
	9.	Base MSRP: Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price.
	10.	Legislative District: Legislative district of the vehicle’s registration.
	11.	Electric Utility: The utility provider servicing the registered address.
	12.	Vehicle Location: Geographical coordinates of the registered vehicle.

Key Insights
	•	Trends: Analyze EV adoption by model year and geographical region.
	•	Eligibility: Explore the impact of CAFV incentives on EV adoption.
	•	Range Analysis: Understand the range distribution across different EV models.

Applications
	•	Visualization of EV growth trends using Tableau.
	•	Identification of regional and manufacturer-specific adoption patterns.
	•	Analysis of factors driving EV adoption, such as incentives and range.

This dataset serves as the foundation for creating interactive dashboards and performing detailed analysis of the electric vehicle market.
